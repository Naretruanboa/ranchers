Login to the node and download the cleanup script:
curl -sLO https://github.com/rancherlabs/support-tools/raw/master/extended-rancher-2-cleanup/extended-cleanup-rancher2.sh

You should now have a copy of the script in the current directory.

Run the script:

The node is now in a clean consistent state to be reused in a cluster.
